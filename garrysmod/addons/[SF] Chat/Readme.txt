Hi, thanks for purchacing ClearChat! Here's how to set it up.

1. Drag the clearchat folder in to your servers addons folder
2. Restart your server (a map change does not count as a restart)

If you wish to change the title of the chatbox, go to lua/autorun/client/cl_scchat.lua and change line 5 to whatever you want.
